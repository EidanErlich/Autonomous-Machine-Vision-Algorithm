Toyota Innovation Challenge - Autonomous Machine Vision Project
Developed as part of the Toyota Innovation Challenge. 
In this project, We successfully built an autonomous machine vision algorithm in a simulated manufacturing environment, 
utilizing C++ object-oriented programming and a depth camera. 
The primary goal of this project was to track a 1:24 scale car model in a noisy environment, identify its wheels, 
and provide real-time positioning data using a depth camera, enhancing manufacturing processes with optimal efficiency and precision.
